Hello! My name is Vasily Tselioudis. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Columbia University, majoring in linguistics and minoring in statistics. I am interested in syntax, computational linguistics, and the Aromanian language. Currently, I am working on my senior thesis for my bachelor's degree.
